# A Simple Project Template for Python and C++ Mixed Programming

## Motivation

It's hard to say that binding C++ with Python is a difficult task. However, for beginners, it's not easy to find a complete and simple enough example to start with. This repository is provided for those who are struggling with the same problem.

## Project Structure

```
.
├── csrc/
│   ├── include/
│   ├── pybind/
│   │   ├── CMakeLists.txt    
│   ├── src/
│   ├── test/
│   │   ├── CMakeLists.txt        
│   ├── CMakeLists.txt
├── python/
│   ├── __init__.py
├── scripts/
│   ├── build_wheel.py
├── README.md
├── requirements.txt
├── setup.py
```

This structure represents a typical project layout for a Python package with C++ binding. The `csrc` directory constitutes a standard C++ project, with the addition of a `pybind` directory for Python binding. The `python` directory, along with `requirements.txt` and `setup.py` files, forms a standard Python project. Certain libraries will be generated by the C++ project and utilized by Python. Lastly, the `build_wheel.py` script integrates all components, encompassing building the C++ project, generating the Python package, and creating a wheel package for installation.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SeanWangJS/pybind-project-template
```

2. Install the dependencies (pybind11 and pybind11-stubgen; you may install them manually)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Build the project

```bash
python scripts/build_wheel.py
```

4. Install the package

```bash
pip install wheels/*.whl
```

## Acknowledgement

This project draws inspiration from the [TensorRT-LLM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM) project. The project structure and the `build_wheel.py` script are borrowed from there.
